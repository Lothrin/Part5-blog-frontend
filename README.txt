PART 5 of the fullstackopen course is concerned with creating the frontend app for the backend application that has been created in the part 4 of the course. 

So "fullstackopen-part4" folder is a copy of the finished backend app from the part4 which you can visit here - https://github.com/Lothrin/fullstackopen-part4

Development and changes in this part (PART 5) will be assumably mostly in bloglist-frontend folder.
